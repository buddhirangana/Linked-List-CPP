# Linked List C++
A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a piece of data and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the List. Linked lists are useful for storing data collections when the collection size is not known in advance or when the data is frequently inserted or deleted.

In C++, we can create a linked list by defining a node class and a linked list class. The node class will represent a single node in the List and contain a data field and a pointer to the next node. The linked list class will contain a head pointer to the first node in the List and various methods for inserting, deleting, and traversing the nodes in the List.
